**  Difference between:
 + static nested class &
 + inner class  **
The main difference between these two is that the inner classes
have access to all member of the enclosing class
(including private), whereas the static nested classes only have
access to static members of the outer class.

In fact, static nested classes behaved exactly like any
other top-level class but enclosed in the only class
which will access it, to provide better packaging convenience.
